This page needs to be filled out. In the mean time, see <a href="https://github.com/ShimmyMySherbet/NewSocket/blob/master/SocketTest/Client.cs">Client</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ShimmyMySherbet/NewSocket/blob/master/SocketTest/Server.cs">Server</a> examples.

### WIP Web Socket library
Features:
* Message Multi-casting (so one large message can't block other messages)
* System of custom 'Protocal Handlers' for different message types.

Current Message Types / Protocals:
